Assumption;Simplification justified by the data?;Problem for our argument?
Complete adaptation after exposure ;No. Ideal adaptation should weight and integrate the observed input from a talker with prior expectations [@kleinschmidt2015robust], so that only partial adaptation is expected after exposure to 30 critical words. Further, even after prolonged exposure, complete adaptation is not necessarily achieved, especially for talkers whose pronunciations deviate heavily from listeners’ prior expectations [@kleinschmidt2016you]. Everything else being equal, we would thus expect that an ideal adapter’s performance in the /d/-exposure condition would fall somewhere midway between the native and /d/-exposure IO model. ;Not for the present purpose, though it is important to keep this assumption in mind when applying the present approach to other data sets. Here, we are not interested in the IO’s absolute performance. We use the IO to compare the predicted maximal benefit of /d/-exposure between the English and Swedish data. That is, we are interested in the IO’s relative performance between the different languages and exposure conditions. Critically, the amount of exposure is very similar between the two experiments. 
Labeled exposure data (supervised adaptation) ;Yes. Lexical decision accuracy on the critical words with syllable-final /d/ was very high both for the English and Swedish data (section \@ref(sec:lexical-decision-accuracy) ;No. 
Only labeled exposure data counts for adaptation (pseudowords are ignored) ;Unclear. Listeners can adapt to shifted distributions without additional information [@munson2011perceptual]. Under some circumstances, adaptation based on unlabelled data can proceed as quickly as adaptation to labelled data [@kleinschmidt2015supervised]. ;Unlikely. None of the English pseudowords contained /t/, /d/ or other voiced plosives. Only two Swedish pseudowords contained /t/ or /d/, and only the /t/ was in syllable-final position. Compared to the 30 lexically-labeled words with syllable-final /d/, these pseudowords are unlikely to have a strong influence on the results. 
No adaptation after exposure ;" No. While the test phase employs minimal pair words, pre-empting lexically-guided adaptation, adaptation can proceed even over unlabelled input [@kleinschmidt2015supervised; @munson2011perceptual]. Since both exposure conditions employ the same test stimuli, adaptation during the test phase would be expected to reduce the predicted differences between the two exposure conditions. "; Unlikely, given that adaptation to unlabelled input would be expected to be slow when native expectations about the covariance between categories cannot effectively guide adaptation [see discussion in @kleinschmidt2015supervised]. Indeed, additional analyses not reported here found no reliable changes in participants' responses during test.
Vowel, closure, and burst duration are the only relevant cues. ; No. Although vowel, closure, and burst duration are cross-linguistically among the primary cues involved in signalling syllable-final stop voicing, there are likely additional relevant cues that we failed to consider. This is also suggested by the fact that listeners were more likely to categorize /d/ productions as /d/ (and /t/ productions as /t/) than predicted by the IO even for the native speaker (Figure \@ref(fig:IO-ratings-results-byItem)). ; Unlikely. Overall, both the native and the /d/-exposure IO's  categorization accuracy over test items was high (Figure \@ref(fig:ideal-observers-accuracy)), suggesting that most of the relevant information was captured by the three measures we collected. 
Multivariate normal distributions for cues ; Approximately, yes. After correcting for phonological context, cue distributions did not exhibit clear signs of multimodality see Figures \@ref(fig:plot-IO-3D-English) and \@ref(fig:plot-IO-3D-Swedish), though distributions were not perfectly symmetric around the mean for some cue dimensions. ;  Unlikely. Multivariate exemplar models would provide an alternative non-parametric approach, although we note that this might introduce degrees of freedom (e.g., $k$-nearest neighbor classification requires a choice of $k$).
Independence of beliefs about different categories ;"  No.  For instance, category means for English syllable-initial stops /p,t,k,b,d,g/ have been shown to be correlated across talkers [@chodroff2017structure; @chodroff2018predictability]. Using the database from @xie2020comparing, we found similarly high correlations between the category means of voiced and voiceless English syllable-final stops. It is also likely that syllable-initial stops and other sounds contain information about the realization of syllable-final stops (e.g., because of talker-specific speech rate), though these correlations are likely less strong than those between different syllable-final stops. ";  Unlikely.  While control exposure completely (English) or almost completely (Swedish) avoided /b,d,g/ and /t/, it was impossible to completely avoid /p,k/. Altogether, control exposure contained 48 and 29 syllable-initial instances of /p,k/ in English and Swedish, respectively, as well as 0 and 10 syllable-final instances of /p,k/, respectively. It seems unlikely that the difference between the English and Swedish experiment in these counts would explain the difference in result. And, if it did, this would still suggest that information provided during exposure about the distributional phonetics of the non-native-accented target category is critical in understanding the benefit of exposure.
Noise-free perception. ; No. Perception is known to be noisy. Listeners' percepts do not veridically reflect the physical stimulus. ; No. As long as perceptual noise follows symmetric distributions, the inclusion of perceptual noise should not affect the relative ranking of goodness-ratings for the different exposure conditions. Rather, the inclusion of perceptual noise might improve the fit against listeners' responses, as the inclusion of perceptual noise should lead to more shallow categorization functions [@feldman2009influence], potentially making the ideal observers' predictions more similar to human rating responses.
Test and exposure drawn from identical distributions. ; Apparently. After correcting for phonological context, the means and covariances of syllable-final /d/ did not differ significantly between exposure and test. ; No.
No learning of non-native phonotactics. ;" Unclear. There is good evidence that effects of phonotactic context can differ between native and non-native speech [@flege1989native; @xie2020comparing]. To what extent such differences are learned within the duration of our exposure phase is not known. "; Possibly. If phonotactic learning of non-native phonotactics takes place it would presumably be more pronounced in the /d/-exposure condition where participants receive direct evidence of how /d/ is affected by surrounding context. This should improve the performance of the /d/-exposure ideal observers relative to the control observers. It is possible that this would change the relative benefit of the /d/-exposure model for the English, compared to the Swedish, experiment.
Equal prior probability of /d/ vs. /t/ during test ;  Apparently. On the one hand, /t/ is more likely than /d/ in this context in both English [@vitevitch2004web] and Swedish. On the other hand, additional analyses not reported here found that the behavioral responses of participants were not significantly affected by those frequencies, perhaps because the test paradigm strongly signals that prior lexical expectations based on typical language use do not transfer to the context of the experiment. Additionally, test words in both experiments were selected to balance the relative frequency of /d/ and /t/ across minimal pairs, precisely in order to avoid strong response biases. ;  No. Results do not qualitatively change if those prior probabilities are instead estimated based on the relative frequency of the two minimal pair neighbors in spoken language use. Inclusion of prior probabilities shifts ideal observer's categorization functions away from the more probable category (expanding it). This shift is constant (in the log-odds of the posterior) across exposure conditions.
No attentional lapses during test ;  Unlikely. Human participants are bound to occasionally lapse during test. On those lapsed trials, participants then respond based on biases rather than based on the perceptual input. ; Unlikely. Lapse rates would be expected to be similar across the two experiments, and thus the inclusion of lapse rates should not change the qualitative predictions of the model (the relative ordering of goodness ratings for the different exposure groups and experiments). An extension of this model that includes lapse rates is presented in @kleinschmidt2016you.
Linear link between posterior probabilities and goodness ratings. ; Yes. At least for the data at hand, data from @xie2017more supports this assumption (see section \@ref(sec:IO-methods-link)). ; No.
