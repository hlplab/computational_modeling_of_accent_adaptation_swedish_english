Step,Correction procedure,Purpose,Fitted with,Applied to
1,Linear regression models for segmental context effects defined for each native language and cue name. Obtains sum of model terms (estimated coefficient * factor)  applied as an offset when computing residual cue values in both Step 1 and 2.,Corrects cues for segmental context effects such as the presence of nasals and rhotics.,Native spoken /d/ and /t/ test words.,All words
2,Linear regression model for suprasegmental context effects defined for each Native Language. Obtains sum of model terms (estimated coefficient * factor) applied as an offset when computing residual cue values.,Corrects for effects of word length and stress,Non-native spoken /d/ words.,All words
