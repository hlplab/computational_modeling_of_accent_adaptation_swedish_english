# TO DO

1) Final clean-up:

 * Check whether warnings are addressed, and then (after) set to silent.
 * Run final compilation with echo = F.
 * Check that all remaining Maryan,Xin,Florian comments have been addressed. 

2) Potential additional analyses:
 
 * Consider adding perception noise to IOs to simulate various subjects. In any case, *explain in IO result section why IO results are more categorical than human responses* (lack of noise is one plausible reason).
 * In particular, do we want to add a section on the alternative Swedish recordings?

3) text editing: **MARYANN**:

 * let's change our terminology to "L2-accented" and "L1-accented" speech, following what we did in Xie et al under review." "native" and "non-native" can be used in the abstract, title, or once in the intro but not beyond. We also aim to avoid "foreign-accented". If the changes lead to indirect, convoluted language for particular instances let's discuss those instances. We don't want to make the paper less accessible but we do want to acknowledge that some people find the terms native and non-native (and foreign-accented) to be problematic.

# Overview

This supplementary information describes the results and methods of the perception experiments on Mandarin-accented English and Flemish-accented Swedish, as well as the development and evaluation of the ideal observer models. The experiment on Mandarin-accented English [@xie2017more] found an effect of exposure to the foreign-accented sound (syllable-final /d/) on subsequent /d/- and /t/-goodness ratings. This effect has been replicated in two other paradigms (categorization and priming) using the same stimuli Xie et al. [@xie2017more]. Additionally, an earlier priming study found the same type of benefit for exposure to syllable-final /d/ in Dutch-accented English (Dutch, like Flemish, exhibits final devoicing, partially or completely neutralizing stop voicing in the syllable final position). In contrast to these previous studies, the experiment on Flemish-accented Swedish did *not* find a significant effect of exposure on subsequent /d/ and /t/-goodness ratings.

We begin by summarizing the methods and results of the two experiments. We find that the native Swedish listeners had an easier time understanding the Flemish-accented speaker than the American listeners had understanding the Mandarin-accented English speaker. This showed in the lexical decision accuracy during exposure, as well as the goodness ratings during test. Throughout the presentation, we review methodological differences between the two experiments and whether they are likely to explain the difference in results. The upshot of this review is that the Swedish null result seems to be *at least in part* driven by the phonetic characteristics of the Flemish-accented speech in our recordings---specifically, that the phonetic distribution of syllable-final /d/ in the Flemish-accented recordings deviated less from typical native Swedish than the phonetic distributions of syllable-final /d/ in the Mandarin-accented recordings deviated from typical American English. Such a difference in the 'non-nativeness' between the Flemish- and Mandarin-accented recordings could be particular to the specific recordings used in the experiment, reflect the talker-specific pronunciation of the speaker we recorded (e.g., due differences in L2 proficiency), or reflect more general differences between Flemish-accented Swedish and Mandarin-accented English. 

Regardless of the specific source of the difference between the Flemish- and Mandarin-accented recordings, the question arises how to *predict* the effect of exposure on native listeners' perception given a specific set of foreign-accented speech stimuli. This motivates the present study: we sought to present a simple but principled approach to quantify the predicted effect of exposure on subsequent perception (here /d/- and /t/-goodness ratings, though the approach we present generalizes to categorization tasks). Ideal observers provide a tool for this purpose, making it possible to predict the effect of exposure on ratings with zero computational degrees of freedom based on only 1) the phonetic properties of the foreign-accented exposure stimuli, 2) the phonetic properties of the  foreign-accented test stimuli, and 3) the phonetic properties of native-accented speech. The third and final component requires some estimates of the phonetic distributions of `typical' native-accented speech. We thus introduce and describe additional data sets containing information about native pronunciations of the same materials used in the perception experiments on foreign-accented speech. 

## Overview of data organization

In Sections \@ref(sec:perception-methods) and \@ref(sec:perception-results), we work exclusively with the perception data from the English and Swedish experiments. The perception data is split into the exposure data (`d.exposure`) and the test data (`d.test`). In Sections \@ref(sec:IO-methods), we use phonetic annotations from both the two experiments and additional sources (together combined into `d.stims`) to train ideal observers (`d.training`) that are then stored in a separate data frame (`d.IO`). Finally, Section \@ref(sec:IO-results) combines the ideal observers with the perception data from the test phase of the two experiments (`d.test`) into one data frame that contains the posterior probabilities, categorization decisions, and /d/-goodness ratings predicted by the various ideal observers for each of the test trials from the experiments (`d.test.IO`).



# Methods of perception experiments {#sec:perception-methods}

We describe the methods used to derive the English [@xie2017more] and Swedish data sets. Both experiments employed an exposure-test paradigm. Exposure was manipulated between participants. Both groups were exposed to foreign-accented speech from the same talker (Mandarin-accented English for the English data; Flemish-accented Swedish for the Swedish data). The two groups of participants differed, however, in whether the exposure materials contained information about the critical phonological category (syllable-final /d/), for which the foreign accent is known to deviate from native pronunciations. The control group never heard any instances of syllable-final /d/ or /t/. The /d/-exposure group heard words with syllable-final /d/, but no words with syllable-final /t/. Following exposure, both groups went through the exact same test phase, during which they made goodness judgments of /d/- or /t/ tokens that were part of minimal pairs (e.g., "seed" or "seat").

In addition to the L1-L2 language pairs (Mandarin-accented English vs. Flemish-accented Swedish) and participants' L1 (American English vs. Swedish), the two experiments exhibited a number of differences that we detail next. This includes differences in i) the number of participants, ii) the instructions and visual appearance of the experiment, iii) the number of stimuli, and iv) minor differences in the stimuli design. This summary aims to be exhaustive and to err on the side of listing differences regardless of whether we believe them to be relevant. For each difference, we describe the design consideration that motivated it, or whether it arose due to misunderstandings/mistakes. We also discuss whether the methodological differences can plausibly explain the differences in results between the two experiments, and what this would entail.

## Amount of data 
Compared to the English experiment, the Swedish experiment had substantially fewer participants (about 50\% fewer) and employed fewer test tokens than the English experiment (about 50\% fewer). This raises questions as to whether the resulting reduction in power could cause a Type II error for the Swedish data. 

### English 
48 monolingual English speakers participated in the experiment (24 /d/-exposure, 24 control). Each participant rated each word (one of the pair) both for goodness as /d/ and for goodness as /t/, resulting in 30 ratings per sound category (/d/ vs. /t/) per rating type (goodness as /d/ vs. goodness as /t/) and 120 ratings per participant.

**Total observations:**  48 \* 30 \* 2 \* 2 = 5760 

### Swedish
25 Swedish speakers recruited from the Department of Swedish \& Multilingualism at Stockholm University participated. Two of the participants were excluded from the analysis because post-experiment surveys found that they were not native speakers of Swedish. Participants were alternately assigned to the /d/-exposure or control group (11 /d/-exposure, 12 control). Each participant rated each word (one of the pair) either for goodness as /d/ or for goodness as /t/, resulting in 16 ratings per sound category (/d/ vs. /t/) per rating type (goodness as /d/ vs. goodness as /t/) and 64 ratings per participant.

**Total observations:**  23 \* 15 \* 2 \* 2 = 1380

### Why the difference?

The decision to recruit a smaller number of participants was made because 1) the Swedish experiment was conceived as pilot experiment for a larger series of experiments still to be conducted, and 2) other previous studies had found significant effects with a similarly small number of participants (12 participants for each of two conditions in @eisner2013constraints).

### What are the expected consequences of this difference?
Power analyses presented in Section \@ref(sec:bootstrap) find that a) the English and Swedish experiment indeed differed in the statistical power they provided, and b) that the difference in statistical power is *highly unlikely* to explain the difference in results between the two experiments.


## Recording of materials {#sec:recording}

By design, the two experiments differ by design in the L1-L2 background of the recorded speaker. Additionally, the two experiments differed in the recording procedure. Whereas the English recordings was elicited without playing a native pronunciation (*unassisted*), the Swedish recordings were elicited by first playing a native pronunciation of the target word (*assisted*). 

### English
Recordings were made of a male native-Mandarin speaker who was a late second language learner of English. This speaker was an undergraduate student enrolled in a U.S. university and had resided in the United States for 18 months at the time of recording. Recordings were made in a sound-proof room using a microphone onto a digital recorder, digitally sampled at 44.1 kHz and normalized for root mean square amplitude to 70 dB sound pressure level.


### Swedish
Recordings were made of a 25-year old, female native speaker of the Brabantish dialect of Central Flanders, with level A1 (CEFR) knowledge of Swedish at the time of recording. Additionally, recordings were made of a female native Swedish speaker of similar age (36). These recordings served as native exemplars for the Flemish speaker. 

Recordings were made in a sound-attenuated room at the Stockholm University Multilingualism Lab. Each trial started with a recording of the target word by the native Swedish speaker, played over Sony MDR-7506 headphones at a comfortable volume. Simultaneously and throughout the trial, the target word was displayed on a computer screen placed within a comfortable viewing distance. An audible beep was played after 2 seconds from trial onset (after the native recording had finished playing) to cue production of the target. Words were spoken into an Audio-Technica AT3035 microphone, placed directly in front of the speaker. Recordings were sampled at 44.1kHz. The experimenter controlled the presentation of each word which appeared three times in random order in order to give the speaker sufficient time and opportunity to say the words correctly. Recording samples were screened for vowel mispronunciation (e.g. mispronouncing a long vowel as short) and excluded from consideration. The word lists were divided into exposure /d/-final words, filler words, replacement words, and test words. These were recorded in separate sessions. Minimal pair test words were presented in separate lists to avoid deliberate contrastive hyper-articulation.

### Why the difference?
The difference in the L1-L2 background of the recorded speaker was part of the design. The central purpose of the Swedish experiment was to replicate the findings of @xie2017more and @eisner2013constraints for another L1-L2 combination. Whether differences between native and non-native accents in the statistics of the cue distributions for /d/ and /t/ could explain the results is the purpose of the present paper (regardless of whether these differences are caused by the L1-L2 pairing, the specific speaker that was recorded, or any other aspect of the recording procedure).

The decision to use an assisted recording procedure for the Swedish experiment was made because the non-native speaker was still in the early stages of L2 acquisition (A1 CEFR). In particular, Swedish has a complex vowel system, with many vowel categories that have no counterparts in the speakers' L1 (Flemish). Furthermore, the mapping from orthography to pronunciation is non-transparent in Swedish. As would be expected, the non-native speaker struggled with vowel pronunciation. After an initial *un*assisted recording session, we therefore decided to re-record the Flemish speaker in the assisted condition. The perception experiment employed the recordings from this latter recording session.

### What are the expected consequences of this difference?
The two recording equipment and environments were similar across the two experiments. Care was taken in both experiments to elicit recording free of noticeable background noise. All three cues (vowel, closure, and burst duration) are durational and therefore unlikely to suffer from minor differences in recording quality. The materials for both experiments are available via OSF. 

The differences in the instructions during recording, however, mightaffect how native-like the recordings of the L2 speaker sound. In previous analyses, we have found that the recording procedure indeed had a strong effect on the pronunciations of the non-native speaker (Tan, Xie, \& Jaeger, 2019). Specifically, we found that the category means of /d/ and /t/ in either of the two recording conditions differed significantly from the native pronunciations of the native speaker whose recordings were used in the assisted condition. However, the recordings in the unassisted condition differed significantly more from the native-accented speech, both in terms of the number of cue dimensions along which the non-native speech differed from native speech and in terms of the degree of difference (for details, see Tan et al., 2019).

It is therefore possible that the decision to use stimuli from the assisted recording condition caused the null effect of /d/-exposure. This would not, however, make the analyses we present here any less relevant for future work. *Any* experiment on speech perception is based on a finite set of speech stimuli. These stimuli can be more or less representative of 'typical' speech from that talker or speech community. In no case, however, is any single experiment going to reflect the range of speech styles and talker types that are present in the speech community. While this raises interesting questions about the generalisability of research on speech perception (for discussion, see @Xie2020comparing), these questions are orthogonal to the more modest goal we pursue here: to predict, for a given set of exposure and test stimuli, what consequences exposure is likely to have on listeners' perception and categorization responses during test. This is the question the ideal observer analyses in Sections \@ref(sec:IO-methods) and \@ref(sec:IO-results) address.
<!-- Maryann, Xin: commented out for now but we might add this in later: In Section \@ref(sec:unassisted), we report a comparison of the IO's predictions for the foreign-accented stimuli recorded in the unnassisted condition and those recorded in the assisted condition. This comparison predicts that a perception experiment with the recordings from the unassisted condition would be substantially more likely to elicit a benefit of /d/-exposure. -->




## Exposure stimuli and procedure

During exposure, participants performed a lexical decision task. Recordings were played over headphones at a comfortable volume. Participants were instructed to decide whether the word they heard was a real word or not. Order of presentation was randomized across participans.

The full list of stimuli is available in Section \@ref(sec:stimuli) for both Swedish and English. In both experiments participants in both groups heard a total of 180 words, including the same 60 filler words in the respective languages and 90 pseudowords that obeyed English or Swedish phonotactical rules. The remaining 30 words were the critical words, manipulated between exposure groups. 

### English
The /d/-exposure group heard 30 critical words ending with \/d\/, and without \/t\/-final minimal pair neighbors (e.g. \textit{overload}). The 30 replacement words for the control group (e.g., animal) were matched to the critical /d/-words in syllable length and mean lemma frequency (based on CELEX, @baayen1995celex). 

All words or pseudowords were multisyllabic and contained three to four syllables. Other than the critical /d/-final words, no other alveolar stops, voiced stops, dental fricatives, and postalveolar affricates occured. The voiceless stops (/k/ and /p/) did not appear in word-final position. 

### Swedish
The /d/-exposure group heard 30 critical words ending with /d/, and without /t/-final minimal pair neighbors (e.g. \textit{episod}). The 30 replacement words for the control group did not contain \/d, t, b, g\/, and were matched in syllable length and average base form frequency (based on a 25 million word database from selected corpora from Språkbanken, https://spraakbanken.gu.se/korp, accessed January 2019). 

All words or pseudowords were multisyllabic and contained two to four syllables. Other than the /d/-final critical words, all stimuli were chosen to avoid voiced stops as well as /t/ in any position (i.e., no /d, t, b, g/). The other two voiceless stops (/k/ and /p/) were kept at a minimum but not fully avoidable in order to have a sufficent number of exposure words. Overall, there were 28 occurrences of /k/ or /p/ in the exposure words for both groups (14 each), and 1 occurrence in the filler words. 

Unintended by the design, one critical word in the /d/-exposure group contained a word-medial syllable-initial /d/ (*medellivslangd*---'average life span'), one pseudoword contained word-medial syllable-initial /d/ (*mörvinder*---'meaningless'), and one pseudoword contained word-final /t/ (*spållrivet*---'meaningless'). 

### Why the difference?
Other than the three unintended occurences of /d,t/, differences between the English and Swedish exposure stimuli were a result of the constraints imposed by the two languages and the goal to balance word frequency across the two exposure groups. Under those constraints, complete avoidance of all stops other than syllable-final /d/ in the /d/-exposure group was not possible.

### What are the expected consequences of this difference?
The  occurrence of word-medial syllable-initial /d/ and word-final /t/ in the pseudoword list are unlikely to explain the null effect for the Swedish data. First off, participants reliably categorized these words as pseudowords (M = 0.96, SD = 0.19). This also means that these two exposure stimuli were not lexically labeled, so that participants did not get information as to whether these stimuli were meant to be pronunciations of /d/ or /t/. Even if participants gathered information from these pronunciations, it is unlikely that the two tokens alone (heard by both groups) led to so much adaptation that no further difference between exposure group could be detected.

Finally, the word-medial /d/ in *medellivslängd* was only heard by the /d/-exposure group and thus cannot not have affected adaptation in the control group. It is also unlikely that the occurrence of syllable-initial /d/ strongly affected adaptation in the the /d/-exposure group. On the one hand, only syllable-final stops are devoiced in Flemish, so that the syllable-initial /d/ pronunciation of the Flemish-accented speaker is unlikely to deviate as strongly from native Swedish pronunciation. But participants in the /d/-exposure group heard 30 words with syllable-final /d/, all of which deviated from native pronunciation. Even if both the two pseudowords and the word-medial /d/ in *medellivslängd* somehow affected participants' ratings during test, we would expect that the 30 critical exposure words with syllable-final /d/ would affect participants' ratings over and above that effect.



## Test stimuli and procedure

The test phase followed immediately after the exposure phase. In both experiments, the test phases started with two blocks in which participants rated recordings of /d,t/-final minimal pair words. Specifically, participants were asked to rate the final sound of the words on a 1-7 scale for how good an example that sound was for the named category (either /d/ or /t/), with 1 being the worst rating and 7 being the best. In one of these two test blocks, participants rated /d/-goodness. In the other test block, they rated /t/-goodness. The two words of a minimal pair never occurred within the same block. The order of the two blocks was counter-balanced across participants. Within each block, order of presentation was randomized across participants.

### English
The test stimuli included 60 monosyllabic minimal pairs ending in /d/ or /t/ (e.g., seed–seat). Other than the final stops, the same restrictions on sounds as in the exposure words were applied here. Across participants, all test words were rated both for /d/-goodness and for /t/-goodness (individual participants rated each word only for *either* /d/- *or* /t/-goodness).

### Swedish 
The Swedish experiment employed fewer test stimuli (64 \/d-\/t\/-final words from 32 minimal pairs,  e.g., *röd*---'red', *comm. gen.* and *röt*---'shout', *pret.*).  Additionally, test words were allowed to have word-initial voiced stops (other than /d/, e.g. *bädd-bett*).

Two pairs, (*vård-vårt* and *hård-hårt*) were excluded from analysis as it was discovered that dental stops preceded by /r/ in Swedish are pronounced differently as retroflexed variations of /d,t/ and therefore would not have been consistent with the rest of the set. This left 30 minimal pairs for analysis (and the test of the ideal observers in Section \@ref(sec:IO-results)).

Due to a misunderstanding, the Swedish data did not counter-balance whether a word recording was rated for /d/- or for /t/-goodness (e.g., the word *rid*---'ride' was always rated for /d/-goodness; the word *rit* ---'rite' was always rated for /t/-goodness; across minimal pair words, /d/- and /t/-final words were equally often rated for /d/- and /t/-goodness). This is unlikely to cause any problems: as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:rating-to-rating-correlation) /d/- and /t/-goodness ratings were almost perfectly inversely correlation, so that the gain in information from having each word rated for both /d/- and /t/-goodness (across participants) is minimal.

Finally, the Swedish experiment contained a third and fourth test block during which participants rated 54 words from 27 /d/-/t/-*initial* minimal pairs (e.g., *dom* and *tom*) for their /d/- or /t/-goodness. The relative order of these later test blocks (/d/- or /t/-goodness ratings) was counter-balanced across participants but participants always completed the test block with word-final ratings *before* performing the word-initial ratings. The data from word-initial ratings tasks are not part of the current analysis, though we note that exposure group did not affect the Swedish word-initial ratings either.

### Why these differences?

The Swedish experiment employed fewer test tokens because it was difficult to find additional minimal pairs for Swedish. While there are many /d/-/t/-final minimal pairs in Swedish, a large number of them share the same stem (e.g., *hård*---'hard', *comm. gen., adverb'* and *hårt*---'hard', *neut., adj.*). As the materials designed for this pilot was done in conjunction with the planning of a similar study involving priming, materials of this type would have been unsuitable and therefore excluded. The limited options also motivated the decision to allow test stimuli in which voiced stops (other than /d/) occurred at the word onset.

The additional test blocks with /d/- or /t/-initial minimal pair words were included in the Swedish experiment in order to investigate the question of whether exposure to devoiced /d/-final words might result in higher goodness ratings for /d/- or /t/-initial words (building on @eisner2013constraints).  

# Results of perception experiment {#sec:perception-results}

We compare the results of the perception experiments on English and Swedish. We first compare lexical decision accuracy during exposure. Then we compare the effect of the exposure manipulation on ratings of /d/-goodness during test.

The analysis of the exposure data serves to make two points. First, lexical decision accuracy during exposure was high across exposure groups and experiments. In particular, we show that participants in the /d/-exposure group recognized the critical exposure words with syllable-final /d/ (and without minimal pair neighbors). This justifies the assumption of lexically-guided adaptation made by the ideal observer we introduce below. 

Second, lexical decision accuracy was substantially higher in the Swedish data. This is one piece of evidence suggesting that the Flemish-accented speaker being easier to process for native Swedish participants than the Mandarin-accented English speaker was for the American participants. 

### English
Lexical decision accuracy was high across both the /d/-exposure (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "English", "/d/-exposure")`) and control group (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "English", "control")`). Accuracy was also high for critical words, including words with syllable-final /d/ in the /d/-exposure group (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "English", critical = T)`). No reaction time data was available.

### Swedish
Figure \@ref(fig:LD-accuracy) summarizes participants' accuracy and reaction time for during exposure. 
Lexical decision accuracy was high across both the /d/-exposure (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "Swedish", "/d/-exposure")`) and control group (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "Swedish", "control")`). Accuracy was also high for critical words, including words with syllable-final /d/ in the /d/-exposure group (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "Swedish", critical = T)`). 

Reaction times were slower in the /d/-exposure group (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure, "Swedish", what = "RT")`). The very high average reaction time for participant 101 in the /d/-exposure group was caused by a single outlier trial, on which the participant took 35 seconds to respond. The difference between exposure conditions does, however, persist if reaction times above 3.5 SDs away from a participant's mean RT are excluded (`r get_LD_performance(d.exposure %>% group_by(Participant) %>% filter(abs(scale(LD.RT)) < 3.5) %>% ungroup(), "Swedish", what = "RT")`).

This suggests that the syllable-final /d/ of the Flemish-accented speaker was indeed accented, leading to additional difficulty beyond whatever other difficulty participants might have experienced while processing the foreign accent.

(ref:LD-accuracy) Lexical decision accuracies and RTs in the Swedish experiment by exposure group: all words (left) or only critical words (right). For the /d/ exposure group, critical words have syllable-final /d/. For the control group, critical words are matched in average length and frequency, but do not contain /d/ (or /t/).

## Goodness ratings during test

We focus here on goodness ratings for test words ending in /d,t/. Unlike the English data, the Swedish data also contained ratings for words beginning with /d,t/. These ratings were always obtained *after* the ratings of /d/-final test words. Ratings of these /d/-intial test words are not analyzed here, though we mention for completeness's sake that /d/-initial test words also did not reveal a significant effect of exposure group for the Swedish data.

We note here that the two experiments differed in the number of subject and items during test. Bootstrap analyses presented later in the SI assess whether this difference in the amount of test data could explain the difference in results. Here we first compare the two data sets using linear mixed-effects models, which do not require data to be balanced. 

### Preparing /d/- and /t/-goodness ratings for analysis

(ref:rating-to-rating-correlation) /d/-goodness ratings during test (z-scored) by native language and exposure group

```{r rating-to-rating-correlation, fig.cap='(ref:rating-to-rating-correlation)', fig.height=4.5, out.width='75%'}
d.test %>%
  filter(NativeLanguage == "English") %>%
  droplevels() %>%
  group_by(Group, Participant) %>%
  mutate(Rating.Response.zscored = as.numeric(scale(Rating.Response))) %>%
  group_by(Language, Group, Item.Word, Rating.for) %>%
  summarise(Rating.mean = mean(Rating.Response.zscored)) %>%
  spread(Rating.for, Rating.mean) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = d, y = t, label = Item.Word)
  ) + 
  geom_label(alpha = .5, aes(fill = Group)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", alpha = .5) +
  scale_x_continuous("/d/-goodness rating (z-scored)") +
  scale_y_continuous("/t/-goodness rating (z-scored)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors.Group) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors.Group) +
  facet_wrap(~ Language) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


The /d/- and /t/-goodness ratings could range from 1 to 7. The two types of ratings were highly inversely correlated (see Figure \@ref(fig:rating-to-rating-correlation)). To simplify data analysis, we thus converted  all goodness ratings into /d/-goodness ratings. For /t/-goodness ratings, this means that we subtracted them from 8 (i.e., if a token was given a /t/-goodness of 3, it is transformed to have a /d/-goodness of 5). This decision does not affect the results: all results remain the same if the original ratings are analyzed while including `rating.for` (/d/- vs. /t/-goodness) and all its interactions as a predictor in the analysis. Following @xie2017more, we then z-scored /d/-goodness ratings within participants, by subtracting the participant's mean and dividing by the participant's standard deviation.

To compare participants' ratings for the /d,t/-final test words across the two experiments, we conducted a linear mixed-effects regression [@baayen2008mixed] over the combined data from both experiments. The regression predicted z-scored /d/-goodness ratings based on the sound category (sum-coded: 1 = word recording intended to end in /d/ vs. -1 = word recording intended to end in /t/), exposure group (sum-coded: 1 =  /d/-exposure vs. -1 = control), the experiment (sum-coded: 1 = Swedish vs. -1 = English), and all their interactions. The regression contained the maximal random effect structure justified by the design (random by-participant intercepts and slope for sound; random by-item intercepts and slopes for sound, exposure group, and their interaction).^[Even this simplified model estimated the variance of the by-participant intercepts to be zero (see below), presumably because the z-scoring of ratings within participant already removed that variance. If all by-participant random effects are excluded, the results reported below do not change. If non-zscored ratings are analyzed instead (unlike in previous work), the three-way interaction is no longer significant ($p = .11$).]

For the by-participant random effects, we had to remove the random slope for sound in order for the model to converge without perfect correlations. All other random correlations are included in the model. Table \@ref(tab:ratings-analysis) summarizes the results. We find a highly significanct main effect of sound, so that foreign-accented productions of /d/ were judged to have higher /d/-goodness than foreign-accented productions of /t/ ($\hat{\beta} = .55, t = 19.3, p < .0001$). The two-way interaction between native language and sound was also higly significant ($\hat{\beta} = .11, t = 3.8, p < .0003$), so that the differences between the /d/-goodness ratings for /d/ and /t/ was larger for the Flemish-accented Swedish speaker than the Mandarin-accented English speaker. One possible interpretation of this is that the Flemish-accented Swedish speaker deviated less from the expectations native Swedish listeners than the Mandarin-accented English speaker deviated from the expectations of American listeners. 

Finally, the three-way interaction between native language, sound, and exposure group was also significant ($\hat{\beta} = -.04, t = -3.3, p < .002$), suggesting that the effect of exposure on /d/-goodness ratings for /d/ and /t/ differed between the Swedish and English experiments. Simple effect analyses revealed that the two-way interaction between exposure group and sound was significant for English, so that /d/-exposure *in*creased the difference in /d/-goodness ratings for /d/ and /t/, compared to the control group ($\hat{\beta} = .04, t = 4.1, p < .0001$). That is, compared to the English control group, participants in the English /d/-exposure group rated the Mandarin-accented /d/ as a better exemplar of /d/ and the Mandarin-accented /t/ as a better exemplar of /t/. This simple effect did not reach significance in the Swedish experiment; in fact, it went in the opposite of the predicted direction ($\hat{\beta} = -.03, t = -1.6, p = .104$).

Next, we consider---and ultimately rule out---three possible explanations for the difference in results between the two experiment. Following that, we present ideal observer analyses that assess whether the distributions of phonetic properties in the exposure and test stimuli predict the differences in listeners' goodness ratings.


### Do outliers explain the English and Swedish rating results?

For the Swedish data it seems that both the /d/-exposure and the control group had two participants each who had ratings that were overall much closer to 0 than was the case for other participants (it is worth pointing out that, these ratings of these participants are not necessarily unexpected compared to the *English* data). To address potential concerns that the difference in the English and Swedish results is driven by these four Swedish participants, we repeated the analysis without these participants. Table \@ref(tab:ratings-analysis) summarizes the results. All effects---including the three-way interaction---remain significant.

```{r ratings-analysis-noOutliers}
lmer.rating.noOutliers = lmer(Rating.Response.d.zscored ~ 
                     NativeLanguage * Group * Sound + 
         (1 + Sound * Group | Item.MinimalPair) + (1 | Participant), 
       data = d.test %>%
         filter(!(Participant %in% c("S105", "S108", "S113", "S122"))) %>% 
         applyContrasts())

tab_model(lmer.rating.noOutliers,
          show.r2 = F,
          title = "(\\#tab:ratings-analysis-noOutliers) Results of linear mixed-effects regression of /d/-goodness ratings after exclusion of the four participants in the Swedish data that have /d/-goodness ratings close to zero.",
          dv.labels = "/d/-goodness rating (z-scored)",
          pred.labels = pred.labels)
```

### Do difference in exposure performance explain English and Swedish rating results?

Another common concern is that participants who do not correctly recognize the critical words with syllable-final /d/ during exposure might not exhibit accent adaptation (e.g, because the input they experienced during exposure is not lexically labeled from the perspective of these participants). We therefore related participants' ratings during test to their accuracy on the critical words during exposure (for the /d/-exposure group, those are the foreign-accented words with syllable-final /d/). For this purpose, we transformed goodness ratings into the goodness rating for the *intended* category, so that higher ratings indicate that listeners perceived the recording to be typical for the sound category it was intended to represent (i.e., /d/-goodness ratings if the recorded word ended in /d/, /t/-goodness ratings if the recorded word ended in /t/). The result is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-and-accuracy). Although the direction of the trend is in the expected direction for the Swedish data, this trend was not significant (see confidence intervals in Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-and-accuracy)).

Since a benefit of /d/-exposure was found for the larger (English), but not the smaller (Swedish), data set, one obvious question is whether the difference in results is due to statistical power. Compared to the English experiment, the Swedish experiment employed about 50\% fewer items and 50\% fewer participants. The Swedish results are thus based on less than 1/4th of the number of goodness ratings as the English results (1,380 vs. 5,760 observations). The resulting reduction in power could explain the null effect for Swedish. The possibility that Swedish experiment reflects a Type II error is further highlighted by the fact that the effect of exposure on the perception of foreign-accented syllable-final /d/ have also been found in other paradigms---both for the same Mandarin-accented stimuli [@xie2017more; @xie2017learning] and for Dutch-accented English [@eisner2013constraints].

To address this possibility, we repeated the linear mixed-effects regression over the combined data from both experiments (reported in Section \@ref(sec:results)), while down-sampling with replacement both the English and Swedish data to 11 participants per group and 30 minimal pair items during test. This hierarchical bootstrap was repeated `r n.bootstrap` times. 

The bootstrap analysis yielded two important findings. First, the analyses suggest that the Swedish experiment was indeed underpowered: the two-way interaction between exposure group and sound present in the original English data does not reliably replicate once the English data is downsampled to (a little less than) the size of the Swedish data. Specifically, the simple effect of the two-way interaction was significant in the predicted direction---i.e., a bigger difference between the /d/-goodness of /d/-final and /t/-final words in the /d/-exposure condition, compared to the control---in `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.English.significant.direction.expected`\% of all bootstrap samples. 

This result does not, however, entail that power explains the null results we observed for Swedish. Indeed, other aspects of the bootstrap results argue *against* this conclusion: even though the downsampled data did not provide high power, the bootstrapped samples reliably showed a clear difference between the English and Swedish data. For instance, even in the downsampled English data, the simple effect went in the predicted direction (regardless of significance) in `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.English.direction.expected`\% of the samples. Significant two-way interactions in the *opposite* of the predicted---and originally observed---direction occurred in only `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.English.significant - d.bootstrap$p.simple.English.significant.direction.expected`\% of all samples (`r round((1-(d.bootstrap$p.simple.English.significant.direction.expected/d.bootstrap$p.simple.English.significant))*100,1)`\% of the samples with significant effects). For the downsampled Swedish data, the simple effect of the two-way interaction between exposure group and sound was significant in the predicted direction in `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.Swedish.significant.direction.expected`\% of all bootstrap samples (overall, the effect went in the predicted direction `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.Swedish.direction.expected`\% of the time). Significant two-way interactions in the *opposite* of the predicted direction occurred in `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.Swedish.significant - d.bootstrap$p.simple.Swedish.significant.direction.expected`\% of all samples (`r round((1-(d.bootstrap$p.simple.Swedish.significant.direction.expected/d.bootstrap$p.simple.Swedish.significant))*100, 1)`\% of the samples with significant effects).

(ref:bootstrap-downsampling) Distribution of $t$-values for the (simple effects) two-way interactions between exposure group (/d/-exposure vs. control) and sound (/d/ vs. /t/) across the `r n.bootstrap` bootstrap samples. The $t$-value of the two-way interaction in the original Swedish data is indicated by the blue vertical line.

In line with our main analysis, this bootstrap result suggests that the effect of exposure on goodness ratings---i.e., the two-way interaction between exposure group and sound---differs between the Swedish and English data. This is also visible in Figure \@ref(fig:bootstrap-downsampling), which summarizes the distribution of the two-way interactions between exposure group and sound for both the English and Swedish bootstrap samples. In light of these differences, it is not surprising that the three-way interaction between native language, exposure group, and sound went in the same direction as in the original data for `r d.bootstrap$p.interaction.direction.expected`\% of the bootstrap samples. This three-way interaction was significant in `r d.bootstrap$p.interaction.significant.direction.expected`\% of the bootstrap samples. Significant three-way interactions in the opposite direction occurred in only `r d.bootstrap$p.interaction.significant-d.bootstrap$p.interaction.significant.direction.expected`\%. 

Finally, we can ask how often the bootstrapped English data returned $t$-values for the two-way interaction that were as large or larger than the $t$-value observed in the original Swedish data. In short, how likely would we be to observe the actual Swedish results if they reflected the same effect as present in the English sample. This was the case on only `r d.bootstrap$p.simple.larger_than_original`\% of all bootstrap samples.


# Methods of ideal observer analyses {#sec:IO-methods}

For both the English and the Swedish data, we compare the predictions of a native model and a non-native model. The native models are meant to predict the behavior of listeners without exposure to the foreign-accented /d/, i.e., listeners in the control condition. The non-native models are meant to predict the behavior of listeners with exposure to the foreign-accented /d/, i.e. listeners in the /d/-exposure condition. 

To this end, we train and test a total of four ideal observers: the native and non-native English models, and the native and non-native Swedish models. Both the native and non-native ideal observer are *tested* on the same foreign-accented minimal pair stimuli from the test phase of the experiments. Below we refer to these as the **test data**. The two models are, however, *trained* on different inputs. To avoid confusion with the set of exposure words used in the experiments, we refer to sets of words used during the training of the ideal observers as the **training data**.  In particular, the native and non-native IOs were *trained on different /d/ tokens*: The non-native IOs were trained on the foreign-accented words with syllable-final /d/ from the /d/-exposure condition. The native IOs were trained on native-accented syllable-final /d/ productions from another database. This training is meant to parallel and capture the difference between the /d/- and control exposure in the experiments.

To derive predictions from the ideal observers it is also necessary to train each ideal observer on data from the /t/ category. Since /t/ was never (or hardly ever) observed in either exposure condition, both the native and non-native model were trained on *native* /t/. In other words, our non-native ideal observer makes the simplifying assumption that the /d/-exposure condition did not convey any information about the /t/ category, so that listeners in the /d/-exposure condition change their beliefs about the /d/ category, but do not change their beliefs about the /t/ category. This simplifying assumption is almost certainly wrong since, for example, talkers' means for different categories tend to correlate [@chodroff2017structure; @chodroff2018predictability]. Such between-category correlations are also observed in the native-English database we used [@Li2020database; see below for details]. However, it is unlikely to bias our results: here we ask whether the predictions of native and non-native ideal observers differ for the English and the Swedish data. Critically, we apply the same simplifying assumption to both the English and the Swedish ideal observers. Any difference we find between the predictions for English and Swedish can therefore not be due to this simplifying assumption.

Figure \@ref(fig:ideal-observer-and-data) summarizes what speech databases we used to train the ideal observers---i.e., to estimate the mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the multivariate Gaussian distributions for the /d/ and /t/ categories in each of the four ideal observers. The dotted lines in Figure \@ref(fig:ideal-observer-and-data) indicate for each category (/d/, /t/) in each model (native vs. non-native x English vs. Swedish), which database it was trained on.

In the following sections, we walk through the steps summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:ideal-observer-and-data). As shown in the figure, we draw on multiple databases. We emphasize that this was a matter of *necessity* rather than choice, and that other researcher who seek to model speech perception across L2 accents and languages (L1s) will likely find themselves in a similar position, requiring trade-offs between available databases and the often disproportionate effort that would be required to obtain better data. Below, we hope to illustrate the steps that are necessary to prepare phonetic data from multiple disparate speech databases to facilitate unbiased model comparison across accents and languages. Specifically, the speech materials in the databases we employ here differ along dimensions that are not of theoretical interest to us, but that could affect the performance of the ideal observers. For example, if we train the ideal observers on the vowel, closure, and burst duration of multi-syllabic words and then test them on the vowel, closure, and burst duration of the mono-syllabic test items (of the English and Swedish experiment), this might make the comparison of the native and non-native models' performance on the test items uninformative. We thus prepared the training and test data by correcting for effects of phonological context, as we describe next. Following that, we describe the training and test procedure for the ideal observers.

(ref:ideal-observer-and-data) Four ideal observer models---a *native* and *non-native* ideal observer each for the English and the Swedish data---were fit and cross-validated against production data from native- and foreign-accented English and Swedish. In the databases (top and bottom), native speech is shown in gray; non-native speech is shown in red. We use the same colors to distinguish between the native and non-native *model*. Each ideal observer has two components: the /d/ and the /t/ category. Training of the ideal observer refers to estimating the mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of these two categories.

knitr::include_graphics("../figures/IdealObserverAndData.png")
```

## Phonetically annotated production data
The ideal observers require estimates of the distribution of the relevant phonetic cues for the syllable-final contrast between /d/ and /t/. Specifically, we need to estimate these distributions for `typical' native-accented productions of /t/ (for both the native and non-native IOs), the native-accented production of /d/ (for the native IO), and the foreign-accented production of /d/ (for the non-native IO). Next, we describe the databases, annotation procedure, and additional steps taken to obtain these estimates.

### English
For the native English IO, the /d/ and /t/ training data came from a database of 10 male native talkers of American English [@Li2020database]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest database of syllable-final stop voicing in native-accented American English for which vowel, closure, and burst duration are annotated. The 10 talkers had the same sex and spanned a similar age range (18-35) as the Mandarin-accented talker in @xie2017more. The recording procedure was the same as in @xie2017more. We used the data of the 10 male native speakers in @Li2020database to estimate the mean and covariance for a *prototypical* native talker's /d/ and /t/. Specifically, we took the prototypical category mean to be the mean of 10 talkers' category means, and the prototypical category covariance to be the mean of the 10 talkers' covariance matrices. This provides an---admittedly very coarse-grained---point estimate of a native listeners' beliefs about a prototypical native talker's /d/ and /t/ categories.

For the non-native English IO, the /t/ training data was the same as the /t/ training data for the native English IO. This reflects our simplifying assumption that the /d/-exposure condition did not contain any information about the non-native /t/ (see above). The /d/ training data for the non-native English IO were the 30 critical words with syllable-final /d/ used during the foreign-accented exposure in @xie2017more. Note that we intentionally did *not* use data from additional non-native talkers in Li et al.'s database: the non-native IO is intended to approximate the beliefs held by a native listener who has perfectly adapted to the foreign-accented /d/ distribution during exposure. 

Of note, the words that were used as training data for the native /d/ were not the same as those used as training data for the non-native /d/. The training data for the native /d/ were all mono-syllabic words with syllable-final /d/ from @Li2020database. Below, we report how we corrected for effects of phonological context and syllable length.

### Swedish
The procedure for the Swedish data was identical with one exception. We did not find any Swedish database comparable to @Li2020database. We thus had access to only the recordings of one gender and age-matched native-accented speaker, judged to have standard Swedish pronunciation. This was the speaker recorded to provide the native pronunciations for the foreign-accented talker (see \@ref(sec:recording)). Instead of estimating a prototypical native talker of Swedish, we thus use the speech from the only native talker we had recordings of to estimate the /d/ and /t/ categories for the native Swedish IO. Thus, unlike for the English IOs, the words that were recorded to estimate the native and non-native Swedish categories were the same. 

As for the English data, the non-native Swedish IO's /t/ category was the same as for the native Swedish IO.

## Annotation and extraction of cues
Tokens were annotated for their duration of vowel, closure, and burst. These three cues are considered primary cues to syllable-final voicing [e.g., @hillenbrand1984perception; @lisker1957closure; @luce1985contextual]. It is therefore likely, but not guaranteed, that the three cues would explain a substantial part of variation in participants' ratings during test. The results of the ideal observer analyses reported below support this assumption: performance of the non-native IO was high for both experiments. This suggests that /d/ and /t/ in both the English and the Swedish data formed clusters that were separable within the 3D space defined by the three cues.

Annotations were completed in Praat [@boersma2001praat] using visual examination of spectrograms, and listening judgments. Cue boundaries were marked following conventions [@flege1992production]. Vowel duration was measured from the beginning of the first periodic portion of each waveform to the zero-crossing where the amplitude decreased abruptly and the waveform became sinusoidal. Burst was measured from stop release to the first zero crossing point where the amplitude became near zero. Closure was measured as the time between vowel offset and burst onset (for stops following nasals, closure onset was marked by an abrupt decline in amplitude of the nasal). All data were annotated by phonetically trained researchers: Maryann Tan for the Swedish data; Ruolan (Leslie) Li for the data from @Li2020database; Xin Xie for the data from @xie2017more.

The realization of phonetic cues is known to be strongly influenced by phonological context [e.g., @ladefoged1957information; @lindblom1967role], and human listeners are known to effectively discount these effects---a process often referred to as *normalization* [e.g., @mann1980influence; @mann1981influence; @johnson200815; @mcmurray2011information]. Additionally, some of the cues to syllable-final /d/ voicing are simultaneously used to signal other contrasts. This is most obviously the case for vowel duration in Swedish. Swedish has a phonological contrast between long and short vowels (e.g., *vit*---'white, comm. gend.' vs. *vitt*---'white, neuter'). Vowel duration is an important cue to this contrast. 

We thus obtained context-corrected phonetic cues by estimating (via linear regression) and removing (via residualization) the effects of phonological context from vowel, closure, and burst duration. By both training and testing the ideal observer on context-corrected cues, we aim to compare like with like. The literature contains many competing approaches to normalization [for a recent review, see @weatherholtz2016speech; @flynn2011comparing; @clopper2009computational; and @adank2004comparison]. Here we follow the *C-CuRE* model [@mcmurray2011information], which captures the intuition behind many previous proposals---that listeners interpret cues relative to the cue value that is *expected* in the present phonological context (*C-CuRE* stands for "computing cues relative to expectation"). C-CuRE-corrected cues have been found to provide a good fit against human categorization of English fricatives [@mcmurray2011information; @mcmurray2016comes] though other studies have found that C-CuRE does not fully capture listeners' ability to correct for talker-specific characteristics, [@kleinschmidt2019structure; @xie2021encoding]. C-CuRE *centers* cues relative to their context by subtracting the context-specific mean of the cue (i.e., the cue's expected value) from each token's cue value. This centering operation is shared with many other common normalization approaches [@lobanov1971classification; @nearey1978phonetic; @johnson200815], though we note that several of these approaches additionally involve standardizing. 

The C-CuRE model has the additional advantage that it is computationally tractable, as the effects of different contexts are assumed to be additive (i.e., the model does not contain interactions between the effects of contexts on cues). Specifically, the C-CuRE-corrected cues are simply the residuals of a linear model that predicts the cue from the linear combination of contexts:

$$corrected\_cue = cue - (\beta_1 context_1 + \beta_2 context_2 + ... + \beta_k context_k)$$

where the $\beta$s are the maximum likelihood coefficients of the following linear model: 

$$lm(cue \sim context_1 + context_2 + ... + context_k)$$

We apply this model to the present data while considering talker, segmental and supra-segmental phonotactic contexts. A number of properties of the English and Swedish production data complicate this procedure, requiring us to estimate context effects sequentially on subsets of the data (see \@ref(fig:summary-cue-correction)). This is not an ideal situation but one that many researchers aiming to predictively model speech perception across L1 and L2 accents will have to face. 

Table \@ref(fig:summary-cue-correction) summarizes the two separate steps we used to estimate effects of segmental and supra-segmental context, which were then combined with correction for talker context. The following sections describe and motivate these steps in detail. Since our goal here is to compare the predicted effect of /d/-exposure and control exposure across the two experiments on English and Swedish, we apply the same steps to the production data of both languages.

(ref:summary-cue-correction) Summary of steps in the cue value correction procedure. For the native Swedish data, the test words are the native recordings of the same words used in the foreign-accented test phase of the Swedish experiment. For the native English data, the test words are the native recordings of the mono-syllabic words with final /d,t/ in @Li2020database. For the non-native data, the /d/ words are the non-native recordings of the /d/-final exposure and test words in the respective experiments.

Previous work has applied and tested C-CuRE normalization on native English only [@kleinschmidt2019structure; @mcmurray2011information; @xie2021encoding]. One question that arises when one applies C-CuRE to both native and non-native data is whether one should employ separate normalization procedures to the two types of data, allowing context to affect native and non-native talkers' productions differently. On the one hand, there are at least two reasons to believe that phonetic context affects non-native talkers differently. First, effects of segmental context are known to be at least partially conventionalized [@lahiri1991mental], and thus would have to be learned by non-native speakers. Second, it is possible that non-native speakers react differently to being recorded, choosing different speech registers. In a study conducted over the @Li2020database database of native and Mandardin-accented English, @xie2020comparing found that effects of phonological context were often reduced in the foreign-accented speech, possibly due to more deliberate articulation and slower speech rates.

This raises questions as to how we should estimate effects of phonological context. One could estimate the effects of phonological context from native data alone or separately for native and non-native speech. The first aproach models the assumption that native listeners do *not* learn how non-native speakers deviate from native speakers in how phonological context affects their speech. The second models the assumption that native listeners learn how non-native speakers differ from native speakers in how they are affected by phonological context.

Here we decided to compute estimates with native data whenever possible. This decision was made because C-CuRE assumes context effects to be additive. @mcmurray2011information estimate effects of phonetic context across all talkers in their data set. This means that effects of phonetic context are assumed to be based on long-term estimates across all previously encountered talkers. For a native listener, these estimates thus likely reflect mostly context effects observed in L1 speech.

For Swedish, we *estimated* (fit) the effects of segmental context from the native recordings of the /d/- and /t/-final words from the test block of the behavioural experiment. For English, recordings of the /d/- and /t/-final words from the experimental test block were available only from the non-native talker. We instead fitted the effects of phonological context with words from @Li2020database. As mentioned above, the words in @Li2020database were slightly different from those in @xie2017more's test block. However, both sets of words were mono-syllabic sets of minimal pairs and included the same type of segmental contexts.^[For the present analyses we excluded all words with nasal codas (e.g. *fond*, *found*) from the @Li2020database. This is because we discovered wider than expected disparities in the annotation of those words compared to that of @xie2017more. This exclusion does not affect any of the qualitative results reported below.]<!-- MARYANN: let's revisit this and make the annotations consistent with each other? It can't change anything given that's it's just a few words but it will remove the need to exclude these items. -->
We did not include words from the English or Swedish exposure data in the fitting of the regression, because test and training words differed in terms of word length (corrected for in Step 2 below). Our procedure thus assumes that the effect of segmental context is identical regardless of word length. This follows the assumption of C-CuRE that effects of phonetic context are additive. However, even if this assumption turned out to be wrong, it does not introduce any obvious bias with regard to the ideal observer comparisons across English and Swedish. 

We considered the following segmental contexts:

 - number_of_segments in the syllable (to capture general compensatory lengthening/shortening [@peterson1960duration; @lindblom1973some; @fowler1981relationship], which can cause segments to be longer in syllables with fewer segments [@klatt1976linguistic]).
 - onset_has_lateral
 - coda_has_lateral
 - onset_has_nasal
 - coda_has_nasal
 - onset_has_rhotic, 
 - phonological vowel length (only relevant to Swedish)
 
as well as the talker context (only relevant for English since the database of @Li2020database comprised multiple L1 talkers). All predictors were treatment coded. Given the high number of possible predictors and to avoid over-fitting, we employed cross-validated backward step-down model reduction to determine which predictors had significant effects on which cues in which language. Specifically, we used the ```validation()``` function from the R package package ```rms'for R''' [@Harrell2020rms]. This resulted in 3 (vowel, closure, burst duration) * 2 (English, Swedish) linear regression models summarized in the following figures. Each figure shows the predicted effect (in msecs) and confidence interval for all predictors. Significance is indicated through stars.

Supra-segmental factors like---lexical stress and speech rate---are also known to affect the phonetic realization of sounds. For example, segments tend to have longer durations in stressed, compared to unstressed, syllables [@lindblom1963spectrographic; @van1987effects] and in words with fewer syllables [@rietveld1987effect]. We thus removed effects of lexical stress, and syllable/word complexity on vowel, closure, and burst duration.

The models were estimated using only the /d/-final words, since the syllable-final /t/ (by design) only occurred as mono-syllabic test words. Furthermore, recordings of multi-syllabic /d/-words in our English database were only available for the non-native talker, forcing us to fit the models with non-native data.^[While the Swedish database had native recordings of multi-syllabic /d/-words we used the non-native data to keep the modeling maximally parallel across the two languages.] Using non-native data for this purpose is not ideal given that C-CuRE is fundamentally meant to estimate the expected cue values based on native realizations but was the only choice available to us.<!-- additional comment to this point--> Our procedure thus assumes that supra-segemental effects are identical for both syllable-final /d/ and /t/. 

The resulting linear regression for both languages was ```cue ~ 1 + number_syllables + has_stress`+ offset(segmental_context)```, where the offset term is the sum of all segmental context effects found to be significant in Step 1 (for that language and cue). Note that there was no need to include Talker as a predictor in this model because both the English and the Swedish data only contained one non-native talker. The following figures summarize the effects of supra-segmental context for the resulting 3 (vowel, closure, burst duration) * 2 (English, Swedish) linear regression models. Each figure shows the predicted effect (in msecs) and confidence interval for all predictors. Significance is indicated through stars.

For the non-native /d/ category, we used all 30 tokens observed during non-native exposure. For the native /d/ and /t/, we sampled 30 tokens with replacement for each talker. The non-native /t/ category was identical to the native /t/ category (for each draw of a training set). In summary, we use the following training data:

- **Native** model: 
  + Exposure /d/ comes from the *native* talker's exposure /d/ (30 tokens)
  + Exposure /t/ comes from the native talker's test /t/ (downsampled to 30 tokens)
  + Test /d/ and /t/ comes from the non-native talker's test /d/ and /t/

- **Non-native** model: 
  + Exposure /d/ comes from the *non-native* talker's exposure /d/ (30 tokens)
  + Exposure /t/ comes from the native talker's test /t/ (downsampled to 30 tokens)
  + Test /d/ and /t/ comes from the non-native talker's test /d/ and /t/

We then calculated the mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ for each unique combination of native language (English, Swedish), model type (native, non-native), sound category (/d/, /t/), and talker. For the native English /d/ and /t/, for which we had 10 talkers' worth of data, we then calculated the mean of the by-talker $\mu$s and $\Sigma$s. Put differently, we marginalize (average over) the 10 different ideal observers for English, to create an ideal observer based on expectations about the 'prototypical' native talker of English. The result of this procedure was one estimate of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ for each unique combination of native language (English, Swedish), model type (native, non-native), and sound category (/d/, /t/). Together the pairs of $\mu$s and $\Sigma$s for /d/ and /t/ form an ideal observer, for a total of four ideal observers (native and non-native English, native and non-native Swedish). Figures \@ref(fig:plot-IO-3D-English) and \@ref(fig:plot-IO-3D-Swedish) visualize the resulting four ideal observers, along with the training data that was used to train these four models.

By applying the native and non-native ideal observers to the stimuli from the test phase of the English and Swedish perception experiments, we can calculate the posterior category probabilities, $p(sound | cues, model)$, for each of those test stimuli. Specifically, we apply the English models to the English test data, and the Swedish models to the Swedish test data. The resulting posterior category probabilities are shown in Section \@ref(sec:IO-methods-posterior-probabilities).

To derive predictions about human behavior from the posterior category probabilities of the ideal observer, it is necessary to specify a linking hypothesis. Previous work has done so for *categorization* tasks [e.g., @clayards2008perception; @kleinschmidt2011bayesian; @kleinschmidt2012continuum; @kleinschmidt2016re; @kronrod2016unified]. We follow these previous works and assume Luce's choice rule---also known as probability matching---and visualize the predictions for categorization tasks in Section \@ref(sec:IO-methods-categorization). Then we specify the linking hypothesis for goodness ratings in Section \@ref(sec:IO-methods-link). To reduce researchers' degrees of freedom, we simply assume a linear link between posterior probabilities and goodness ratings. This essentially makes the same assumptions as Luce's choice rule makes for categorization. We validate the linking hypothesis against human data from another experiment [Experiments 2 and 3 of @xie2017more].

```


### Categorization accuracy {#sec:IO-methods-categorization}

As in our previous work, we assume that the ideal observer employs Luce's choice rule (also known as probability matching) to categorize inputs. Under this assumption, the ideal observer responds by sampling from its posterior. If the posterior probability of a /d/ is, say, .45 for a given stimulus, the observer will on average respond "d" on 45\% of all trials and "t" on 55\% of all trials. This choice rule does thus not introduce any additional degrees of freedom. 

Figure \@ref(fig:ideal-observers-accuracy) shows the predicted accuracy for a hypothetical categorization task over the test stimuli for the English and Swedish experiment. Critically, the non-native ideal observer patterns consistently with human responses from the /d/-exposure groups; we elaborate on this in section (ref:Group-level comparison between human and model-predicted ratings). Critically, the ideal observers for English, achieves high accuracy over the foreign-accented test stimuli, consistently higher than the native ideal observer.

               position = position_dodge(.93)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Accuracy") 
```


### Linking hypothesis for goodness ratings {#sec:IO-methods-link}

Here we assume a linear link with 0 degrees of freedom between the posterior probability of /d/ and the predicted rating of /d/-goodness. Specifically, for visualization that compare the ideal observers' prediction against human data, we simply multiply posterior probabilities by 2 and subtract 1, to obtain predicted /d/-goodness ratings that range from -1 to 1, which is approximately the range observed for z-scored human ratings (see Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-results) in Section \@ref(sec:results)). For analyses, we predict human z-scored /d/-goodness ratings from ideal observer predicted posterior probabilities of /d/.

The assumption of a linear link between posterior probabilities and goodness ratings predicts that categorization responses and rating responses should be linearly correlated, which we validate next.

### Validating the linking hypothesis in human data

@xie2017more conducted both an identification and a rating experiment using the exact same Mandarin-accented English exposure and test items employed here. The exposure task was the same for both experiments (lexical decision, as already described). Only the test task differed. In the identification task, participants provided categorization responses ("Did the word end in a /d/ or /t/?") rather than ratings. This allows us to compare categorization and rating responses against each other. If posterior probabilities map linearly onto both ratings and categorization, as assumed here, we should see a linear relation between categorization and rating responses.

Figure \@ref(fig:ID-to-ratings) shows the item-level correlation in participants' rating and categorization responses across the two experiments. At least for the range of test stimuli in @xie2017more, the link between ratings and categorization indeed seems to be linear.

(ref:ID-to-ratings) Item-level correlation of human identification and rating responses from two experiments in @xie2017more. The two experiments used the same exposure and test stimuli, and differed only in the task during test (categorization vs. rating). The trend line shows a generalized additive model fit with a non-parametric smoother. That is, the fit would in principle allow non-linearity in the relation between categorization and rating responses. The fact that no non-linearity is detected suggests that the relation is largely linear. Shaded areas show 95\% confidence intervals.

# Results of ideal observer analyses {#sec:IO-results}

<!-- Maryann, Xin: this text needs to be expanded, following the style used in the remainder of the SI -->

We evaluate the ideal observers against human responses in two ways. First, we qualitatively compare *average group-level* for the two exposure groups (/d/-exposure vs. control). Second, we analyze and visualize item-level correlations between the ideal observer and human responses.  

## Group-level comparison between human and model-predicted ratings

Figure \@ref(fig:IO-ratings-results-byItem) plots the predictions of the ideal observers. Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-results-byItem) replots the human rating results for the English and Swedish experiments from Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-results) in Section \@ref(sec:results). However, unlike the original Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-results), Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-results-byItem) shows by-item (rather than by-subject) means. This is done to facilitate comparison to the ideal observer predictions, which---by necessity---are predictions about individual items. 

(ref:IO-ratings-results-byItem) **Ideal observer /d/-goodness ratings** during test (z-scored) predicted by the native and non-native ideal observers. Error bars show 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals over by-item predictions (since there aren't multiple subjects). To facilitate comparison to the human data, predicted ratings were derived from each ideal observer by projecting its predicted posterior probability of /d/ linearly onto the range of the human z-scored /d/-goodness ratings (see Section \@ref(sec:IO-methods-link)). This was done only for the purpose of visualization---all analyses presented below directly predict human ratings from the ideal observers' posterior probabilities.

(ref:ratings-results-byItem) **Human /d/-goodness ratings** during test (z-scored) by native language and exposure group. To facilitate comparison of the human data to the ideal observer models in Figure \@ref(fig:IO-ratings-results-byItem), we first aggregate the human data by exposure condition and *item*, averaging across all subjects. These are the individual points shown in the figure. The bars show the mean of these by-item means, and the error interval shows the 95\% confidence interval over the by-item means. This contrasts with Figure \@ref(fig:ratings-results) in Section \@ref(sec:results), where we plotted the mean and confidence interval of by-subject means. 

```{r IO-ratings-results-byItem, fig.cap="(ref:IO-ratings-results-byItem)", fig.height=4.5, out.width='75%'}
p.results.perception.bySubject %+%
  (d.test.IO %>%
     filter(Model.Accent.matchesGroup == "yes") %>%
     group_by(Language, NativeLanguage, Group, Sound, Item.WordID, Model.Accent) %>%
     summarise(Rating.mean = mean(Model.Posterior.d * 2 - 1))) +
  scale_y_continuous("Ideal observer predicted\n/d/-goodness rating (z-score aligned)") +
  scale_fill_manual("Ideal observer",
    breaks = c("/d/-exposure", "control"),
    labels = c("non-native", "native"),
    values = colors.Accent
  ) +
  ylim(-1.25, 1.25)
```


```{r ratings-results-byItem, fig.cap="(ref:ratings-results-byItem)", fig.height=4.5, out.width='75%'}
p.results.perception.bySubject %+%
  (d.test %>%
     group_by(Language, NativeLanguage, Group, Sound, Item.WordID) %>%
     summarise(Rating.mean = mean(Rating.Response.d.zscored))) +
  ylim(-1.25, 1.25)
```

The ideal observers' predictions differ from the human ratings in a number of ways. First, the human data is more gradient than predicted by the ideal observers. This is most evidence for the Swedish data. One likely explanation for this is that the simple ideal observer models we employ here do not account for perceptual noise [cf. @feldman2009]. <!--MARYANN: can you fill in? --> Second, the differences between the different ideal observers are more pronounced than for the z-scored human ratings. This is the case both across languages, and across exposure conditions within each language.

The ideal observers do, however, predict the of the qualitative patterns in the human goodness ratings:

 + For the English data, the ideal observers predict significantly higher ratings from the non-native model over the native model for both /d/ and /t/. 
  
 + For the Swedish data, the ideal observers predict no difference between the native and non-native model for /d/ but higher ratings for the the *native* model for /t/. This qualitatively mirrors the asymmetry between /d/ and /t/ observed in the human ratings, though the effect for /t/ is only marginal for the human ratings.

## Item-level comparison between human and model-predicted ratings

We first predicted human responses across all native languages and exposure conditions from the ideal observers that are meant for those languages and exposure conditions. That is, we predict human ratings in the /d/-exposure group from the non-native ideal observer, and human ratings in the control group from the native ideal observer. Specifically, we use a linear mixed-effects regression, predicting human /d/-goodness ratings from the posterior probability of /d/ predicted by the ideal observers, while also including the maximal converging random effect structure (random intercepts by participant and minimal pair). 

This analysis is summarized in Table \@ref(tab:ratings-IO-analysis) and found a highly significant effect of ideal observer predicted posterior probabilities on the z-scored human goodness ratings ($\hat{\beta} = 1.14, t = 35.1, p < .0001$). 

```{r item-level-regression-between-ID-rating-tasks}
d.test.IO %<>%
  applyContrasts()

lmer.IOtoRating =
  lmer(Rating.Response.d.zscored ~ 1 + Model.Posterior.d + 
         (1 | Item.MinimalPair) +  (1 | Participant), 
                     data = d.test.IO %>%
                       filter(Model.Accent.matchesGroup == "yes"))
# summary(lmer.IOtoRating)

pred.labels = c("Intercept", "IO-predicted posterior of /d/")
tab_model(lmer.IOtoRating,
          show.r2 = F,
          title = "(\\#tab:ratings-IO-analysis) Results of linear mixed-effects regression of /d/-goodness ratings on ideal observer posterior /d/ predictions.",
          pred.labels = pred.labels,
          dv.labels = "/d/-goodness rating (z-scored)")
```






<!-- ### What drives the effect of ideal observer predicted posterior probabilities? -->
<!-- To understand better what drives the correlation between ideal observer predictions and human ratings, we repeated the above analysis while incrementally including additional control predictors in the model. We started by adding only native language, then the full factorial of native language and exposure condition, and finally the full factorial of native language, exposure condition, and sound category. At each step, we asked whether the effect of the ideal observer predicted posterior probability of /d/ was still significant. All control predictors were sum-coded (native language: English = -1 vs. Swedish = 1; exposure group: control = -1 vs. /d/-exposure = 1; sound category: /t/ = -1 vs. /d/ = 1), and all analyses contained the the maximal by-item random effect structure (random intercept and slopes for exposure group, sound category, and their interaction) and by-participant random intercepts (more complex random effect structures by participant did not converge).  -->

<!-- The effect of the ideal observer predicted posterior probability of /d/ remained significant when native language or its full factorial with exposure group were added to the model ($p$s $< .02$), but stopped being a significant predictor once sound category was included in the model. This final analysis is summarized in Table \@ref(tab:ratings-IO-analysis-full). Together with the first analysis, this suggests that the effect of the ideal observer predicted posterior probability is largely driven by the fact that the ideal observer correctly predicts whether a sound should be categorized as /d/ or /t/. -->

### Do ideal observers that model an exposure condition predict human /d/-goodness rating responses *better* than ideal observers intended for a different exposure condition?

Next, we asked whether ideal observers that match the exposure conditions (i.e., the native ideal observer for the control condition and the non-native ideal observer for the /d/-exposure condition) provide a better fit against human ratings than ideal observers that do not. This would provide the strongest item-level evidence that the ideal observers we constructed capture the effects of exposure in the English and Swedish experiments. To this end, we repeated the linear mixed-effects analysis while including the posterior predictions for both matching and non-matching ideal observers in the analysis and letting them interact with an indicator variable (sum-coded: non-matching = -1 vs. matching = 1) and the native language (sum-coded: English = -1 vs. Swedish = 1). The analysis again contained random intercepts by participant and minimal pair.

This analysis replicates the effect of ideal observer predicted posterior probabilities on the z-scored human goodness ratings ($\hat{\beta} = 1.16, t = 49.3, p < .0001$). This effect interacted with native language ($\hat{\beta} = 0.15, t = 6.4, p < .0001$), indicating a stronger effect for Swedish. A simple effect analysis reported in Table \@ref(tab:ratings-IO-model-comparison) confirmed that the effect of ideal observer predicted posterior probabilities was highly significant for both languages. No other effect, including any of the interactions with the indicator variable, reached significance.   

```{r item-level-regression-between-models}
contrasts(d.test.IO$Model.Accent.matchesGroup) = cbind("Yes.vs.No" = c(-1, 1))
d.test.IO$cModel.Posterior.d = d.test.IO$Model.Posterior.d - mean(d.test.IO$Model.Posterior.d)

lmer.IOtoRating.ModelComparison =
  lmer(
    Rating.Response.d.zscored ~ 1 + NativeLanguage / (cModel.Posterior.d * Model.Accent.matchesGroup) + 
      (1 | Item.MinimalPair) + (1 | Participant), 
                     data = d.test.IO)

pred.labels = c("Intercept",
                "NativeLanguage (Swedish vs English)",
                "English : IO-predicted posterior of /d/",
                "Swedish : IO-predicted posterior of /d/",
                "English : IO matches exposure (Yes vs No)",
                "Swedish : IO matches exposure (Yes vs No)",
                "English : IO-predicted posterior : IO matches exposure",
                "Swedish : IO-predicted posterior : IO matches exposure")
tab_model(lmer.IOtoRating.ModelComparison,
          show.r2 = F,
          title = "(\\#tab:ratings-IO-model-comparison) Results of linear mixed-effects regression of /d/-goodness ratings on matching vs non-matching ideal observer models.",
          pred.labels = pred.labels,
          dv.labels = "/d/-goodness rating (z-scored)")
```

In short, we did *not* find evidence that ideal observer that match the exposure condition of human participants did significantly better in predicting human goodness ratings. One possible reason for this becomes apparent when we visualize that predictions of the ideal observers. Figure \@ref(fig:plot-3d-test-IO-English) and \@ref(fig:plot-3d-test-IO-Swedish) visualises the posterior predictions of the native and non-native ideal observers for all test token. Figure \@ref(fig:plot-3d-test-IO-English-difference) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-3d-test-IO-Swedish-difference) show the *difference* between the predictions of the native and non-native ideal observers. These latter figures thus highlight the test tokens that can distinguish between the native and non-native models. 

On the one hand, the results are encouraging: the non-native model predicts the intended (non-native) category better for both English but not for Swedish, paralleling the results for human ratings. On the other hand, these plots also show clear limitations of the present approach: for many test tokens, the native and non-native ideal observers make basically identical predictions, limiting our ability to distinguish between the two models. This provides a straightforward explanation as to why ideal observers that match the exposure condition do not provide a better fit against human ratings: the native and non-native model do not differ sufficiently much in their predictions. We note that this is not *necessarily* a limitation of the ideal observers but might rather reflect a limitation of experiments that use natural speech stimuli as test tokens. These natural speech stimuli were not chosen so as to maximize the statistical power to detect differences between the exposure groups (or ideal observers) but rather reflect the natural distribution of the relevant non-native accent.

(ref:plot-3d-test-IO-English-difference) Difference between non-native and native ideal observer predicted posterior probabilities of the *intended* category for all test tokens of the experiment on English. The posterior probability predicted by the native ideal observer is subtracted from the posterior probability predicted by the non-native ideal observer. Positive value thus indicate test tokens for which the non-native ideal observer makes better predictions.

<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:IO-ratings-results-correlation-byItem) shows the correlation between ideal observer posterior predictions and human /d/-goodness ratings of each item in both the English and Swedish experiments. The left column shows the correlation of human ratings with a mismatched ideal observer model, that is, an ideal observer that was modelled for the opposing condition. The column on the right shows the correlation with ideal observers for that intended condition.  -->

<!-- For the English data, the non-native ideal observer correlates with human ratings in *both* exposure conditions, whereas the native ideal observer did not correlate with human ratings in either exposure condition. That is, the non-native ideal observer performed better in predicting human ratings regardless of whether it matched the exposure condition. This is unexpected. While the correlation with human ratings was numerically highest when the ideal observer's assumptions matched the exposure condition, follow-up analyses reported below found that this difference was not significant. For the Swedish data, both the native and the non-native ideal observers exhibited significant correlations of with human ratings. The magnitude of these correlations did not differ depending on whether the ideal observer matched the exposure condition. In short, while the ideal observers correctly predict the qualitative pattern found in the human results, the item-level analyses suggest that the ideal observers either predict the correct qualitative patterns for the wrong reasons, or that the ideal observers ....XXXX  -->
